# [TF2] Fixed Friendly Fire

Primarily made for free-for-all gamemodes and maps, this plugin attempts to fix the incredibly broken friendly fire in Team Fortress 2.

The full list of fixes is too big for me to want to type it out, but if you can think of it, I've most likely fixed it.

**Note:** The plugin does nothing if `mp_friendlyfire` is not enabled.
